# Kotlin RecyclerView App

This project is an Android app developed as part of the Android module at the Syntax Institute. It is written in **Kotlin** using **Android Studio** and focuses on mastering the **RecyclerView** component, a key element for displaying dynamic lists in Android applications. The app demonstrates how to efficiently display and manage large datasets in a scrollable list, along with best practices for implementing adapters and view holders.

## About the App

The Kotlin RecyclerView App showcases how to use the **RecyclerView** component to create a performant and flexible list of items. It includes features like displaying a list of data, handling item clicks, and dynamically updating the list. The app also emphasizes the importance of separating concerns by using **Adapters** and **ViewHolders** to manage the UI and data binding.

## Features

- **RecyclerView**: Efficiently display a scrollable list of items.
- **Item Click Handling**: Respond to user interactions with list items.
- **Dynamic Data Updates**: Add, remove, or update items in the list dynamically.
- **Adapter and ViewHolder**: Implement a custom adapter and view holder to manage list items.

## Technologies and Concepts
